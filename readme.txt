Author Recent Posts shows recent posts by an author on the posts written by the author as a responsive widget. This plugin is useful for multi-author WordPress blogs.

== Description ==

Author Recent Posts plugin displays more posts by an author on a post written by him. This plugin contains a responsive widget to show recent posts by an author on all the single posts which are created by that author.

You can show the widget on single posts (not pages) in the sidebar. Additionally, use the shortcode to display the widget within the post content. This plugin is useful when you have multiple authors on your WordPress blog and you wish to display recent posts by the particular author of the post a visitor is currently viewing.

With this plugin, you can choose the number of posts to display, show or hide the featured image, alternate image URL, dimensions of the featured image, display the post date or not. You can also show the author name in the title using '[author]' shortcode (without quotes) in widget options.
